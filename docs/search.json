Now which patients (and their indices) experience a decrease? Of those that experience a decrease what is the average decrease?\nThe code below provides the patient identifier (Subject_No.) and the index. In the new vector (“subvector”), we are passing the indicies to only pull patients with a positive decrease.\n\nwhich(diff &gt; 0)\n\n Subject_2  Subject_4  Subject_6  Subject_7  Subject_8  Subject_9 Subject_10 \n         2          4          6          7          8          9         10 \nSubject_13 Subject_14 Subject_15 Subject_16 Subject_17 Subject_18 Subject_19 \n        13         14         15         16         17         18         19 \nSubject_20 \n        20 \n\npositive_diff_indices &lt;- diff &gt; 0\nsubvector &lt;- diff[positive_diff_indices]\nmean(subvector)\n\n[1] 10.6\n\n\nWe can see from the above that of those patients that have a decreased in blood pressure, the average decrease is 10.6 units"
